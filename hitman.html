            <p>Michael Bryce prepares to retire from being a bodyguard and tries to clear his mind 
                on vacation until Sonia Kincaid tracks him down and asks for his services. She needs 
                his help in recovering her hitman husband Darius, after mobsters kidnap him. 
                After saving him, they are caught by Interpol agent Bobby O'Neill, who needs 
                their help in locating a terrorist mastermind named Aristotle Papadopoulos, 
                who wants to destroy the European power grid and infrastructure since the 
                European Union is planning to impose more sanctions on Greece.</p>
