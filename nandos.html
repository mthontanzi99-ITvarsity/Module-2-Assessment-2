            <p>At Nando's, we select only the best succulent chickens and trim them of
                 extra fat before they are marinated in Nando's traditional Peri-Peri 
                 flavours... so the unique Nando's taste is absorbed right down to the bone. </p>
            <p>The restaurant was founded in 1987 in the Johannesburg suburb Rosettenville, 
                by Mozambique-born Fernando Duarte and South African-born Robert Brozin. 
                Upon visiting a Colonial Portuguese-African takeaway named Chickenland, 
                and trying the chicken with peri peri (a sauce that was first developed 
                in nearby Mozambique and further refined in South Africa before being 
                exported to other Portuguese territories and mainland Portugal) they 
                bought the restaurant for about 80,000 rand.</p>
