            <p>In 1985 Mexico City, Heinrich Treadway tries to escape the authorities 
                and a man, Bathurst. He and his associates, Abel and Leona speak about 
                "the Egg," which Treadway stole from Bathurst. Treadway tells Abel that if 
                he does not survive, the latter must remember to "look inside". He drives 
                off a bridge, jumping from his car in mid-air and onto a crane 150 feet away. 
                However, Treadway watches helplessly as Bathurst arrives and kills Abel and Leona.</p>
