            <p>In 1989, Jack Toretto participates in a race, with his sons 
                Dominic and Jakob in his pit crew. Dom argues with rival racer Kenny Linder 
                about his dirty tactics. As the race resumes, Linder's car clips Jack's 
                bumper and causes the car to hit a wall and explode, killing him. After the 
                crash, Dom is arrested after nearly beating Linder to death. While serving 
                his sentence, he learns about the dangers of a hairline crack, recalls 
                that Jakob had worked on Jack's car the day he died, and concludes that Jakob 
                was partially responsible for their father's death. Upon release, 
                Dom confronts and challenges Jakob to a race, forcing him to leave town when he loses</p>
